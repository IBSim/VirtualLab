    check to see that both unit_length and gridsize are valid and have not both
    been defined at the same time.

    Note: the calculation of unit_length is in reality handled deep in the C++
    code. This is because the code incorporates a small displacement to the grid
    "epsilon" to try and avoid vertices falling directly on the grid
    (see "util.h" line 98). Thus this function is a bit of a hack in that it
    always returns just the gridsize. Either the user supplied value
    (assuming it is valid) or the calculated value from the unit length.
    It then hands that off to the c++ code to calculate the
    "actual" unit_length.

    Note this function converts gridsize from a list to an np array in the final step.
