Introduction
============

VirtualLab is a python package which enables the user to run Finite Element (FE) simulations completely via the command line. The pre and post processing is carried out using the software SALOME, while the FE solver CodeAster is used for the simulation. While this package has been written for command line use some capabilites have been included to use the GUI for debugging and training.

Setup
*****

To use VirtualLab there are a few things which must be set up. The first is that you have both SALOME and CodeAster installed on your computer. Once this is done you need to add the SALOME directory to your path so that salome can be opened by just typing ‘salome’ in a terminal window. Talk to Llion

Layout
******

In the top level directory (TLD) of VirtualLab you will find the *Run* file which is used to launch simulations along with the essential directories needed for running simulation; *Scripts*, *Materials* and *Input*. Alongside these a directory named *Output* will be created containing all the information relevant to your analysis. The contents of these are explained in more detail below. 

Run
#####

This file contains the relevant information required to run analysis using VirtualLab, such as the type of simulation or the mode in which it is run.

Simulation
----------

This indicated the type of simulation which will be run. The simulations currently available are:

* Tensile: A standard tensile test where a component can either be loaded with a constant force or constant displacement.

* LFA: Laser flash analysis experiment where a component is pulsed with a short, high heat flux from a laser.

* HIVE: Heat by Induction to Verify Extremes is an experimental facility at the UK Atomic Energy Authority to expose plasma-facing components to the high temperatures they will face in a fusion reactor.

Project
-------

This specifies the project you are working on, such as a type of component which is being tested. 

StudyName
---------

This groups together simulations, for example if you are testing out different magnitude of loads, you could name this ‘LoadingAnalysis’ and all relevant simulations will be saved here.

Parameters_Master & Parameters_Var
----------------------------------

These files are used to create *Parameters* file(s) which are essential to using VirtualLab. *Parameters* contain information such as the geometrical measurements and boundary conditions required to construct meshes and run simulations. Parameters_Master is the master file which contains all of the variables required and is sufficient without Parameters_Var. The Parameters_Var file is used in conjunction with Parameters_Master to create multiple parameter files, which enables running multiple simulations concurrently. If Parameters_Var is set to None a single parameter file is created (a copy of Parameters_Master). 

Mode
----

You will notice that when the VLSetup class is initialised a key-word argument ‘mode’ is passed – this dictates how much information is printed in the terminal. There options available are;

* Interactive: Prints all output to the terminal

* Continuous: Writes the output to a file as it is generated

* Headless: Writes output to file at the end of the process (default)

Scripts
#######

This directory contains all scripts necessary for setting up and running VirtualLab. The sub-directory *Common* contains the scripts necessary to setup the VirtualLab environment for any type of simulation. There are also sub-directories for each type of simulation, insde which are the relevant *SALOME* and *CodeAster* scripts used, along with additional simulation-specific data such as different laser pulse profiles for *LFA* simulations. 

Materials
#########

This directory contains the material properties which will be used for simulations. The sub-directories are different materials, each of which contain material properties. Some materials are non-linear with temperature dependence. 

Input
#####

The Input directory contains the *Parameters_Master* and *Parameters_Var* files referenced previously and can be found in Input/$SIMULATION/$PROJECT. 

Output
######

This directory will be created in the TLD to hold all of the data generated by VirtualLab. The meshes created can be found in Output/$SIMULATION/$PROJECT/Meshes, while the simulation results can be found in Output/$SIMULATION/$PROJECT/$STUDYNAME
